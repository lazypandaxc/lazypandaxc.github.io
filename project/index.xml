      <description>Introduction My two datasets include the World Happiness Report data and the income of different countries in the year of 2019 for my project. The World Happiness Report dataset originally included the overall rank, country or region, score (of happiness), GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perception of corruption as its variables. I wanted to focus on less variables, so I ommited the ‘Overall rank’, ‘Social support’, ‘Freedom to make life choices’, ‘Generosity’, and ‘Perception of corruption’ variables of the World Happiness Report dataset using the select function in R.</description>

      <description>INTRODUCTION In the fall, I will be pursuing a master’s in social work, and one of the main aspects in the field is looking at inequalities that are prevelant in society today. Decades of research have been done to understand the research inequality that prevails our country today. This dataset looks at a student’s test performance. The categorical variables include a student’s gender (‘gender’) and whether or not they had completed a test preparation course (‘test preparation score’) which will be indicated by ‘completed’, or ‘not completed’.</description>
